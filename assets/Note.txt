As a disciplined student, I have always believed that whenever you take a task, complete it, do full justice with it. May it be academics, sports, projects or extracurricular activities I have given my best.

I have done several part-time jobs in the different sections of my college like the account section, lab in-charge, etc. Other than I have also volunteered for management work in some events.

Once I start work, I don’t get distracted until I complete it. And I believe this is very essential and positive characteristics of anyone’s personality trait. If I am hired, if I get the opportunity I will use my full strength and knowledge to complete all my tasks and add value to the company. I would also like to learn and seek assistance from the professionals I would be working under.

I am having a semester break till 10th July so till that time i will be completely available and invest my whole time here, but i can assure you that even after the end of Vacation i will give enough time to the assigned tasks and will complete them before the deadline.
